### Hi there 👋

I'm Natalino, a Computer Science student at [42 Lausanne](https://42lausanne.ch).

After trying the “traditional path” (EPFL, HEIA)… I realized lectures and theory weren’t my thing.  
So here I am at **42**, learning programming the hard way: **peer-to-peer, no teachers, just pure code** 🚀

- 🌱 Currently working on: **42 core projects** 
- 💻 Interests: **game development** 🎮 and **artificial intelligence** 🤖  
- 🚀 Goal: become a **skilled software engineer**
- ⚡ Fun fact: fueled by ☕ and competitive gaming (aiming high both in code and games !)
